Signal your intention to change lanes if needed to overtake the slow-moving or stationary construction vehicle safely.\n   - **Stay in Lane:** If changing lanes is not possible due to traffic, maintain your position and stay alert to any sudden stops from the vehicle ahead.\n  \n4. **Watch for Workers and Road Users:**\n   - **Roadside Workers:** Be continuously alert for any unexpected movements from the workers on the right side near the yellow utility vehicle. Road workers may step into the road unexpectedly.\n   - **Motorcyclist:** Monitor the motorcyclist on the left to ensure that you do not inadvertently move into their path during your lane change or if they decide to speed up or change lanes themselves.\n  \n5. **Navigate Tight Spaces:**\n   - **Barriers and Cones:** Navigate cautiously between any barriers and traffic cones on the right. Ensure that you have enough safe space to maneuver without hitting any obstacles.\n  \n6. **Be Prepared to Stop:**\n   - **Pedestrians and Workers:** Be prepared to stop if any pedestrian or road worker suddenly enters the driving path.\n   - **Changing Road Conditions:** Watch for any debris or sudden lane changes due to ongoing construction activities.\n\n7. **Weather and Road Conditions:**\n   - **Wet Roads:** Given the overcast weather, assume the road might be wet and slippery. Reduce speed accordingly to maintain control over the vehicle.\n  \n8. **Utility Vehicle and Additional Hazards:**\n   - **Parked Utility Vehicle:** Approach the parked yellow utility vehicle cautiously, watching for any doors opening or workers emerging from behind it.\n\n### Summary:\nMaintain a safe following distance, reduce speed, be prepared to change lanes safely, continuously monitor the construction workers and motorcyclist, navigate around barriers and traffic cones carefully, and be ready to stop for any unexpected road users or changes in traffic flow. Drive with caution, especially considering the construction zone and potential wet road conditions."}

{"question_id": 433, "image": "test/images/4201.jpg", "question": "There is an image of traffic captured from the perspective of the ego car. Focus on objects influencing the ego car's driving behavior: vehicles (cars, trucks, buses, etc.), vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists), traffic signs (no parking, warning, directional, etc.), traffic lights (red, green, yellow), traffic cones, barriers, miscellaneous(debris, dustbin, animals, etc.). You must not discuss any objects beyond the seven categories above. Please provide driving suggestions for the ego car based on the current scene.", "answer": "In this scenario, the following driving suggestions are appropriate:\n\n1. **Maintain Safe Following Distance**: The ego car should maintain a greater following distance from the construction vehicle ahead to allow for ample reaction time in case of sudden stops or debris falling from the vehicle.\n\n2. **Reduce Speed**: Slow down due to the construction activity and presence of workers and machinery in the vicinity. This will ensure better control over the vehicle and the ability to stop quickly if required.\n\n3. **Stay Alert for Vulnerable Road Users**: Keep a careful watch on the sedan and the motorcyclist visible on the left side of the road. Ensure they do not make any sudden lane changes or other unexpected movements.\n\n4. **Signal Lane Changes Early**: If it becomes necessary to change lanes to overtake the construction vehicle, use turn signals well in advance, and check mirrors and blind spots carefully.\n\n5. **Observe Roadside Workers**: Be especially cautious of the construction workers on the right side near the utility vehicle and the sidewalk. They may step onto the road unexpectedly.\n\n6. **Navigate Lane Narrowing and Barriers**: The presence of barriers and traffic cones means the lane width might be reduced. Maintain vehicle position to avoid grazing these obstacles.\n\n7. **Monitor Construction Zone Instructions**: Look for any temporary traffic signs, signals, or hand signals from construction workers that provide specific instructions for navigating the construction zone.\n\n8. **Be Prepared to Stop**: Be ready to stop if any road workers or equipment suddenly appear in the driving lane or if the construction vehicle stops abruptly.\n\n9. **Cautious Overtaking**: If overtaking is absolutely necessary, ensure the maneuver is executed with maximum caution, considering the presence of other vehicles and road users.\n\n10. **Avoid Right-Lane Zigzagging**: Since the barriers and traffic cones constrain the right lane, committing to the left lane for any necessary overtaking might be safer and more predictable for surrounding traffic.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the ego vehicle can safely navigate the seen traffic conditions and potential hazards in the current road environment."}
