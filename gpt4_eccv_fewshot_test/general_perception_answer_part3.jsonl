The ego car needs to be aware of which lanes are accessible and may need to merge or change lanes to continue safely.\n\n4. **Dynamic Environment**: The presence of active workers suggests the construction zone is dynamic, with possible changes to traffic patterns, which means the ego car needs to adapt in real-time to new conditions.\n\nIn summary, the construction worker within the red rectangle signifies a dynamic and potentially hazardous environment. For the ego car, this means increased vigilance, reduced speed, and readiness to take evasive maneuvers to ensure the safety of road workers and compliance with traffic regulations in construction zones."}
